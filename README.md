# FPSTracker
This is my school project for ASP.NET for creating a FPS Tracker
The site allows you to add games and a UserName connected to a game that is in the DB
Then you can enter your match stats for a game from the DB and connect your username to it as well.

What I want to add later in the course.

The ability to only display the UserNames under the specified game that was clicked on
And only display the matches under the specified game that are also linked to te user.
